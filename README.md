# TecoGAN
This repo will contain source code and materials for the TecoGAN project, i.e. code for a TEmporally COherent GAN.

We're currently still busy preparing the source code... stay tuned! For now, enjoy the video and pre-print of our paper.

# Additional Generated Outputs

Below you can find three additional sequences generated with TecoGAN. Our method generates fine details that 
persist over the course of long generated video sequences. E.g., the mesh structures of the armor,
the scale patterns of the lizard, and the dots on the back of the spider highlight the capabilities of our method.
Our temporal discriminator plays a key role to guide the generator network towards producing coherent detail.
